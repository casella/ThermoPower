<h2><a name="ThermoPower"></a>ThermoPower</h2>
<p>
<b>Open library for thermal power plant simulation</b><br>
</p>
<h3>Information</h3>

<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>The ThermoPower library is an open-source <a href="http://www.modelica.org/libraries">Modelica library</a>
 for the dynamic modelling of thermal power plants and energy conversion
 systems. It provides basic components for system-level modelling, in 
particular for the study of control systems in traditional and 
innovative power plants and energy conversion systems.</p>
<p>The libray has been under continuous development at Politecnico di 
Milano since 2002. It has been applied to the dynamic modelling of steam
 generators, combined-cycle power plants, III- and IV-generation nuclear
 power plants, direct steam generation solar plants, organic Rankine 
cycle plants, and cryogenic circuits for nuclear fusion applications. 
The main author is Francesco Casella, with contributions from Alberto 
Leva, Matilde Ratti, Luca Savoldelli, Roberto Bonifetto, Stefano Boni, 
Leonardo Pierobon, and many others. The library is licensed under the <b><a href="http://www.modelica.org/licenses/ModelicaLicense2">Modelica License 2</a></b>.
 The library has been developed as a tool for research in the field of 
energy system control at the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e
 Bioingegneria of Politecnico di Milano and progressively enhanced as 
new projects were undertaken there. It has been released as open source 
for the benefit of the community, but without any guarantee of support 
or completeness of documentation.</p>
<p>The latest released version is 3.1 Beta 0. which uses Modelica 3.2 
revision 2 and Modelica Standard Library 3.2.1. If you have used the 
development version of ThermoPower since 2011 to develop your models, 
then they should run with version 3.1 of the library with little or no 
modification.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, changes might be introduced to improve 
the handling of initial conditions, that could break your models 
developed with ThermoPower 3.1. These changes will be incorporated in 
version 3.2.</p>
<p>The library has been mainly developed using the tool <a href="http://www.dynasim.se/">Dymola</a>,
 but it is designed to also run with any other tool that fully supports 
Modelica 3.2 revision 2 or later. The current coverage of the library by
 the latest nightly build of the <a href="https://openmodelica.org/">OpenModelica</a> compiler is reported <a href="https://test.openmodelica.org/libraries/ThermoPower/BuildModelRecursive.html"> here</a>.</p>
<p>You can download the released versions from the <a href="https://github.com/modelica-3rdparty/ThermoPower">GitHub mirror</a>. The current development version of the source code can be checked out anonymously using an SVN client using this URL:<br><br><a href="svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/thermopower/svn/trunk">http://svn.code.sf.net/p/thermopower/svn/trunk</a><br><br>If you are running Windows, we recommend using the excellent <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a> to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that since 2013 the structure of the Flow1D models, which
 are the backbone of heat exchanger models, has been revised for greater
 flexibility and ease of use. New thermal ports are used and the heat 
transfer model is embedded inside the Flow1D model as a replaceable 
model. Old Flow1D models (with their thermal counterparts) have been 
kept in the library for backwards compatibility, but they are deprecated
 and should not be used to build new models. They are identified by an 
obsolete marker on the icon. Also the old source and sink components 
using the deprecated cardinality operator are kept for backwards 
compatibility, but have been replaced by new components using 
conditional input connectors.</p>

<h2>Release notes:</h2>
<p><b>Version 3.1</b></p>
<p>
This is a major new release, that has been in the making for 5 years. 
The new release is not compatible with 2.1. However, models built using 
the development version of the library after 2011 should compile with 
little or no adjustments. It has many new features:
</p><ul>
  <li>Use of Modelica 3.2.1 revision 2 and Modelica Standard Library 
3.2.1, ensuring full compatibility with all compliant Modelica tools</li>
  <li>Tested with Dymola and OpenModelica.</li>
  <li>Use of stream connectors, compatible with the Modelica.Fluid library, allowing multiple-way connections (see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3384/ecp09430078">paper</a>).</li>
  <li>Use of the homotopy operator for improved convergence of steady-state initialization problems(see <a href="https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2011/Proceedings/pages/papers/04_2_ID_131_a_fv.pdf">paper</a>).</li>
  <li>Improved Flow1D models with embedded replaceable heat transfer 
models, allowing a much easier customization of heat transfer 
correlations</li>
  <li>Many bug fixes</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p><b>Version 2.1 (<i>6 Jul 2009</i>)</b></p>
<p>The 2.1 release of ThermoPower contains several additions and a few 
bug fixes with respect to version 2.0. We tried to keep the new version 
backwards-compatible with the old one, but there might be a few cases 
where small adaptations could be required.</p><p>ThermoPower 2.1 
requires the Modelica Standard Library version 2.2.1 or 2.2.2. It has 
been tested with Dymola 6.1 (using MSL 2.2.1) and with Dymola 7.1 (using
 MSL 2.2.2). It is planned to be usable also with other tools, in 
particular OpenModelica, MathModelica and SimulationX, but this is not 
possible with the currently released versions of those tools. It is 
expected that this should become at least partially possible within the 
year 2009. </p><p>ThermoPower 2.1 is the last major revision compatible 
with Modelica 2.1 and the Modelica Standard Library 2.2.x. The next 
version is planned to use Modelica 3.1 and the Modelica Standard Library
 3.1. It will use use stream connectors, which generalize the concept of
 Flange connectors, lifting the restrictions that only two complementary
 connectors can be bound.</p>
<p>This is a list of the main changes with respect to v. 2.0</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>New PowerPlants package, containing a library of high-level reusable
 components for the modelling of combined-cycle power plants, including 
full models that can be simulated. </li>
<li>New examples cases in the Examples package. </li>
<li>New components in the Electrical package, to model the generator-grid connection by the swing equation </li>
<li>Three-way junctions (FlowJoin and FlowSplit) now have an option to 
describe unidirectional flow at each flange. This feature can 
substantially enhance numerical robustness and simulation performance in
 all cases when it is known a priori that no flow reversal will occur. </li>
<li>The Flow1D and Flow1D2ph models are now restricted to positive flow 
direction, since it was found that it is not possible to describe flow 
reversal consistently with the average-density approach adopted in this 
library. For full flow reversal support please use the Flow1Dfem model, 
which does not have any restriction in this respect. </li>
<li>A bug in Flow1D and Flow1D2ph has been corrected, which caused 
significant errors in the mass balance under dynamic conditions; this 
was potentially critical in closed-loop models, but has now been 
resolved.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The connectors for lumped- and distribute-parameters heat transfer 
with variable heat transfer coefficients have been split: HThtc and 
DHThtc now have an output qualifier on the h.t.c., while HThtc_in and 
DHThtc_in have an input qualifier. This was necessary to avoid incorrect
 connections, and is also required by tools to correctly checked if a 
model is balanced. This change should have no impact on most 
user-developed models. </li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><b>Version 2.0 (<i>10 Jun 2005</i>)</b></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>The new Modelica 2.2 standard library is used. </li>
<li>The ThermoPower library is now based on the Modelica.Media standard 
library for fluid property calculations. All the component models use a 
Modelica.Media compliant interface to specify the medium model. Standard
 water and gas models from the Modelica.Media library can be used, as 
well as custom-built water and gas models, compliant with the 
Modelica.Media interfaces. </li>
<li>Fully functional gas components are now available, including model 
for gas compressors and turbines, as well as compact gas turbine unit 
models. </li>
<li>Steady-state initialisation support has been added to all dynamic models. </li>
<li>Some components are still under development, and could be changed in the final 2.0 release: </li>
<li>Moving boundary model for two-phase flow in once-through evaporators. </li>
<li>Stress models for headers and turbines. </li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><b>Version 1.2 (<i>18 Nov 2004</i>)</b></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>Valve and pump models restructured using inheritance. </li>
<li>Simple model of a steam turbine unit added (requires the Modelica.Media library). </li>
<li>CISE example restructured and moved to the <code>Examples</code> package. </li>
<li>Preliminary version of gas components added in the <code>Gas</code> package. </li>
<li>Finite element model of thermohydraulic two-phase flow added. </li>
<li>Simplified models for the connection to the power system added in the <code>Electrical</code> package. </li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><b>Version 1.1 (<i>15 Feb 2004</i>)</b></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>No default values for parameters whose values must be set explicitly by the user. </li>
<li>Description of the meaning of the model variables added. </li>
<li><code>Pump</code>, <code>PumpMech</code>, <code>Accumulator</code> models added. </li>
<li>More rational geometric parameters for <code>Flow1D*</code> models. </li>
<li><code>Flow1D</code> model corrected to avoid numerical problems when the phase transition boundaries cross the nodes. </li>
<li><code>Flow1D2phDB</code> model updated. </li>
<li><code>Flow1D2phChen</code> models with two-phase heat transfer added. </li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><b>Version 1.0 (<i>20 Oct 2003</i>)</b></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>First release in the public domain</li>
